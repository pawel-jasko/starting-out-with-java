/* Programming task assigned in T. Gaddis, Starting Out with Java, 7th ed.
 * 
 * Task 2.11. Circuit Board Profit
 * 
 * Instruction:
 * 
 * "An electronics company sells circuit boards at a 40 percent profit. If you know the
 * retail price of a circuit board, you can calculate its profit with the following 
 * formula: Profit = Retail price Ã— 0.4
 * Write a program that asks the user for the retail price of a circuit board, calculates 
 * the amount of profit earned for that product, and displays the results on the screen."
